# Sex Education for the modern world
Too often we think of sex education as being about penises and vaginas, about infections and babies, but the reality is that sex is about intamacy. It's time our sexual education reflected that.

This repository is meant to be an opinionated starting place to craft sexual education for people of all ages.

We owe many thanks to the National COalition for Sexual Health and Altarum, who developed structure of our sexual education framework.
